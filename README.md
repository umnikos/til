# TIL - Tiny Inventory Library for ComputerCraft
An alternative to [AIL](https://github.com/ShrekshelleraiserCC/abstractInvLib) created specifically to be used within [hopper.lua](https://github.com/umnikos/hopper.lua) (for -storage).
Only has basic functionality and the api is (currently) unstable.
It is performant (admins won't complain about it lagging the server), but mostly single-threaded (it transfers items slower than [AIL](https://github.com/ShrekshelleraiserCC/abstractInvLib), although still at a respectable speed).

If you wish to use this in a project either fork it or contact me for support.
You could also just use [hopper.lua](https://github.com/umnikos/hopper.lua) which does have a stable api and uses this library under the hood.
